# Creates two scheduled tasks:
#   REX_Morning_Pipeline  - 8:00 AM weekdays (catches overnight SEC filings)
#   REX_Evening_Pipeline  - 5:30 PM weekdays (processes Bloomberg data finalized by 5 PM)
#
# Both tasks:
#   - Wake the PC from sleep (WakeToRun)
#   - Run even on battery power
#   - Run if the PC was off at trigger time (StartWhenAvailable)
#   - Auto-kill after 1 hour (safety timeout)
